        Who We Are: Tuinue Wasichana
      </h1>

      <p className="text-lg mb-6">
        <strong>Tuinue Wasichana</strong> is more than just a donation platform
        — it's a transformative movement that seeks to uplift, empower, and
        protect the dignity of school-going girls across Sub-Saharan Africa. At
        our core, we believe that no girl should miss out on an education
        because of her period, nor should she be forced into silence by stigma,
        poverty, or systemic inequality.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-600 mb-2">Our Mission</h2>
      <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
        Our mission is to create a sustainable ecosystem of support where
        menstrual hygiene is accessible, education is uninterrupted, and girls
        can rise into their full potential with confidence and dignity. We
        harness the power of recurring donations and community partnerships to
        deliver menstrual health kits, educational programs, mentorship, and
        life skills training directly to schools and underserved communities.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-600 mb-2">
        Why We Exist
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
        In many parts of Sub-Saharan Africa, girls miss school for up to 5 days
        each month due to a lack of menstrual products, eventually leading many
        to drop out entirely. This is not just a health issue — it's a human
        rights issue. Tuinue Wasichana exists to challenge this injustice and
        rewrite the future for thousands of young girls by breaking the silence,
        bridging the resource gap, and advocating for lasting change.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-600 mb-2">Our Values</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-6 text-lg space-y-2">

        Our Approach
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
        Tuinue Wasichana combines technology and compassion. Donors can give
        through our platform knowing that every contribution directly funds
        meaningful interventions — from sanitary pad distribution to building
        girl-friendly sanitation facilities and hosting leadership camps. We
        work hand-in-hand with educators and community leaders to identify needs
        and ensure sustainable delivery of support.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-600 mb-2">
        Our Impact So Far
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
        Thanks to our growing network of donors and partners, we've reached
        thousands of girls across rural and peri-urban areas, improved school
        attendance, and helped open conversations around menstruation and
        gender. But this is just the beginning — the need is vast, and we are
        determined to scale our mission across the continent.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-600 mb-2">Join Us</h2>
      <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
        Whether you're a donor, a volunteer, a teacher, or a passionate
        advocate, there is space for you in this mission. Let’s stand together
        to ensure that every girl is given the freedom to thrive — not in spite
        of her gender, but because of her strength.
