      <h1> About Us </h1>

      <div className="card">
        <p>
          <strong>Tuinue Wasichana</strong> is more than just a donation
          platform — it's a transformative movement that seeks to uplift,
          empower, and protect the dignity of school-going girls across
          Sub-Saharan Africa. At our core, we believe that no girl should miss
          out on an education because of her period, nor should she be forced
          into silence by stigma, poverty, or systemic inequality.

        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
          Our mission is to create a sustainable ecosystem of support where
          menstrual hygiene is accessible, education is uninterrupted, and girls
          can rise into their full potential with confidence and dignity. We
          harness the power of recurring donations and community partnerships to
          deliver menstrual health kits, educational programs, mentorship, and
          life skills training directly to schools and underserved communities.

        <h2>Why We Exist</h2>
        <p>
          In many parts of Sub-Saharan Africa, girls miss school for up to 5
          days each month due to a lack of menstrual products, eventually
          leading many to drop out entirely. This is not just a health issue —
          it's a human rights issue. Tuinue Wasichana exists to challenge this
          injustice and rewrite the future for thousands of young girls by
          breaking the silence, bridging the resource gap, and advocating for
          lasting change.

            leaders, thinkers, and change-makers.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Dignity:</strong> Every girl deserves to feel confident and
            unashamed of her body and her period.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Equity:</strong> We fight to close the opportunity gap
            caused by poverty and gender bias.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Transparency:</strong> We ensure every donation is traceable
            and impactful.

            and local leaders to drive grassroots impact.

        <h2>Our Approach</h2>
        <p>
          Tuinue Wasichana combines technology and compassion. Donors can give
          through our platform knowing that every contribution directly funds
          meaningful interventions — from sanitary pad distribution to building
          girl-friendly sanitation facilities and hosting leadership camps. We
          work hand-in-hand with educators and community leaders to identify
          needs and ensure sustainable delivery of support.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="card">
        <h2>Our Impact So Far</h2>
        <p>
          Thanks to our growing network of donors and partners, we've reached
          thousands of girls across rural and peri-urban areas, improved school
          attendance, and helped open conversations around menstruation and
          gender. But this is just the beginning — the need is vast, and we are
          determined to scale our mission across the continent.
        </p>

        <p>
          Whether you're a donor, a volunteer, a teacher, or a passionate
          advocate, there is space for you in this mission. Let’s stand together
          to ensure that every girl is given the freedom to thrive — not in
          spite of her gender, but because of her strength.
